l-version# website
The code for the older versions of the www.harshaash.website
The initial unstructured code is in master while the code which as written just after training in UI for Mu-Sigma is in initial-version branch

The actual code deployed on the server until its replacement is in avilon. (Its text might not be the same. I have lost the actual code and was able to scrape only this much. URL's should be mapped if deployed)

This website was replaced with the current wordpress built account. To see code snippets for the wordpress account read https://github.com/HarshaAsh/wordpressSnippets
