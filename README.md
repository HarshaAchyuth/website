2-version# website
Why: www.harshaash.website is my personal blog
Where: Written while working at MuSigma, written for www.harshaash.website
What: The code for the older versions of the www.harshaash.website when it was deployed as a stand alone app.
When: Code from starting of training on UI at MuSigma to when it was redesigned in wordpress.
How: The initial unstructured code is in master while the code which as written just after training in UI at Mu-Sigma is in initial-version branch. This code was never deployed.
The actual code deployed on the server until it's redesign is in avilon branch. (Its actual content might not be the same. I have lost the actual code and was able to scrape only this much. URL's should be mapped if deployed)

This website is replaced with the a wordpress built website. To see code snippets for the wordpress account refer https://github.com/HarshaAsh/wordpressSnippets
