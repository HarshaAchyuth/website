2-version# website

Why: www.harshaash.com is my personal blog. The blog was hosted on Godaddy, and was developed from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. There were three versions of the standalone app, the first version, written completely using HTML, CSS and Javascript is in branch [initialVersion](https://github.com/HarshaAsh/old_website_code/tree/initialVersion). The second version (branch [AngularJS_code](https://github.com/HarshaAsh/old_website_code/tree/AngularJS_code)) has the same UI as the first version but it is written in AngularJS. The third version (branch [avilon](https://github.com/HarshaAsh/old_website_code/tree/avilon)) is written using a wordpress template Avilon. These are the older versions of the website as the latest website is completely developed on wordpress.

Where: Written while working and training as a UI-developer at MuSigma  

What: The code for the older versions of the www.harshaash.website when it was deployed as a stand alone app before.

When: From starting of training on UI at MuSigma, to when it was redesigned in wordpress.

How: The initial unstructured code is in master while the code which as written just after training in UI at Mu-Sigma is in initial-version branch. This code was never deployed.
The actual code deployed on the server until it's redesign is in avilon branch. (Its actual content might not be the same. I have lost the actual code and was able to scrape only this much. URL's should be mapped if deployed)

This website is replaced with the a wordpress built website. To see code snippets for the wordpress account refer https://github.com/HarshaAsh/wordpressSnippets
